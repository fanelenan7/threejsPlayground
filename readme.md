This is my first attempt at using Three.js and it has been pretty successful.

> Why did you choose this subject?

I researched popular JS libraries and went with the rule of cool.

> What problem does it solve?

Ummm. Just serves as a cool screensaver I guess.

> What is the history of this technology?

Three.js is a JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser.
Three.js uses WebGL.

Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello to GitHub in April 2010. Cabello's contributions include API design, CanvasRenderer, SVGRenderer and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project.

> What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

Easy to get into, hard to master. It's a very robust library, full of pretty amazing methods.

> What resources do you recommend for interested students?

Docs themselves are not very detailed, but a lot of them come with demos. Look at the source code and figure out how it's done.

> What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

Just trying to figure out what does what. As I mentioned before, the library is very robust and has a lot of built in methods. Also, figuring out how many arguments to pass in was fun. TetrahedronGeometry with more than one argument created a rather amusing blob.

> Do I need to include it in my HTML with <script> tags?

You could. I just prefer to have a separate js file.

> Can I deploy it to Heroku?
I guess? I see no reason why not. This version is deployed to GitHub pages.

Overall it was a very interesting experiment.
